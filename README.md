## StarDB application

//JS,React,Webpack,Babel,Bootstrap,FetchAPI

This is my educational project.
It is written using class components and function components.
Implemented components that, at the request of the user, receive data from the API, process it and return it to the user.
App navigation organized with React Router.
Used Lifecycle Methods, Context.
In it, I trained the skills to work with React patterns like: render functions,props childern,HOC,composition of HOC's.
